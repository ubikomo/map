			NEW YORK, Dec. 16, 2021 - On Nov. 8, Earnest Foods opened in Jamaica, Queens, as the community’s first and only Black-owned and organic grocery store- a feat for a community that, according to a 2019 research by Food Bank for New York, has been found to have the worst case of food insecurity in the state of New York due to the area being characterized as a food swamp, among other factors.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2020/20_0029.htm">According to the CDC</a>, food swamps are "uenvironments saturated with unhealthy foods because of the large numbers of corner stores and fast-food outlets in them."
		</p>
		<p>
			George Williamson, a lifelong resident of Jamaica and the general manager at Earnest Foods, says the presence of an organic store in Jamaica, let alone a Black-owned one, is an anomaly.
		</p>

		<p>
			“We don’t have nothing like this in the neighborhood,” Williamson said. “We are not used to seeing things like this. We are not used to seeing a Black-owned business carrying these kinds of foods.”

			Issues of food access accross the state of New York has been of rising concern since the opening of Earnest Foods, with many individuals brining up the lack of access to healthy food options in commuities that are populated predominantly with individuls who are considered minorities, just like Jamaica.
		</p>
		<p>
			Williamson says it is not about just having access to food, but having a choice in the kinds of foods every indivual gets to make and eat.
		</p>
		<p>
			"If you were to get a plate of food and then someone sprayed the same things that they spray on them when they’re growing, I don’t think you would want to eat it," Flowers said, "Organic tastes different."
		</p>
		<p>
			According to data from the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Retail-Food-Stores/9a8c-vfzj">Department of Agriculture and Markets</a>, while Jamaica has a lot of stores which sell food items, most of these stores are cornerstores and pharmacies. This creates a very small amount of stores that sell healthy meals.

			Jamaica is not alone there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Accross all boroughs, access to healthy food seems disproportionate. While Manhattan, Brooklyn, and The Bronx have large amounts of healthy food stores, Queens has less and that number is drastically reduced in Staten Island. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Williamson says people need to call on officials and support the creation of more healthy food stores, not only to create healthier communities, but to also create a future where healthy food is the norm.
		</p>
		<p>
			"It’s good so the next generation can have something to aspire to," Williamson said.
